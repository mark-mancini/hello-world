# hello-world

Hey All,

I'm excited to be here! Although I'm completely new to the technology space, I'm driven to learn as much as possible from everyone I meet.  
I'm building on my experience in sales, operations, and the customer experience.  
Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors, music, and eating and drinking with family and friends. During the pandemic, I've been learning the piano. My wife and I were married in August 2020.
Please reach out so we can connect!
